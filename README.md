# Graph-Project
 Hello! This is our first practice project for the 'Graph Theory' course!
 
 We got txt files from Ratton's website as inputs and we saved the outputs [here](https://github.com/gustavo-m-vieira/Graph-Project/tree/main/src/testFiles/testAnswerFiles)
The output contains detailed information about each graph component, as well as information about the nodes' degrees.
Due to computational problems (graph too large, better environments with more memory and processing power is necessary) we couldn't process grafo_5 and grafo_6.
